### My Geographical Locations

I was born in *Izhevsk*.

I graduated from the Faculty of Architecture at the University in the city of *Leningrad* (now it is *St. Petersburg*). During my student period, I often visited *Peterhof*, which is a suburb of *St. Petersburg*. Later, in the IMCP class, for a student project, I made a video about _**Peterhof**_

I lived and worked in *Kaliningrad* (it was *Koenigsberg*, a historic Prussian city) from 90th.
